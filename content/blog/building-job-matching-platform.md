# Building a Full-Stack Job-Matching Platform with Next.js & Ollama

## Introduction

Job searching can be overwhelming with countless applications and mismatched opportunities. I built an AI-powered platform that intelligently matches resumes with job descriptions, making the process more efficient for both job seekers and employers.

## Why Next.js for SSR Performance

I chose Next.js for its excellent server-side rendering capabilities, which are crucial for SEO and initial load performance. The App Router provides clean routing structure, and API routes handle backend logic seamlessly.

## Integrating Ollama LLaMA 3 Locally

Privacy was a key concern, so I integrated Ollama LLaMA 3 to run AI processing locally. This ensures sensitive resume data never leaves the user's environment while providing powerful matching capabilities.

## Backend Logic and PDF Parsing

The backend handles PDF parsing using libraries like pdf-parse, extracting key information from resumes and job descriptions. The matching algorithm considers skills, experience, and requirements to generate compatibility scores.

## UI/UX Design Choices

I focused on clean, intuitive design with clear visual feedback for matching results. The interface guides users through the upload process and presents results in an easily digestible format.

## Lessons Learned and Future Improvements

This project taught me the importance of balancing AI capabilities with user privacy. Future improvements include adding more file formats, enhanced matching algorithms, and integration with job boards.
