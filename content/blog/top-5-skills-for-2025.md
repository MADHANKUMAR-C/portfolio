Here are five skills I believe every web developer should invest in this year:

1. HTML & CSS — the foundation for accessible and responsive interfaces.
2. JavaScript — modern syntax, async patterns, and the web platform.
3. React — component-driven UIs, hooks, and performance.
4. Tailwind CSS — rapid and consistent styling with design tokens.
5. Git — collaborating, branching strategies, and clean commit history.
