I began my Computer Science and Design journey with curiosity and a drive to build real products. Early on,
I focused on the fundamentals: semantic HTML, modern CSS, and accessible UI patterns.

From there, I moved into JavaScript and TypeScript, exploring frameworks like React and Next.js.
My first end-to-end app taught me database design, authentication, and the joy of deploying to production.

This blog will document my progress and share insights that might help others starting out.
